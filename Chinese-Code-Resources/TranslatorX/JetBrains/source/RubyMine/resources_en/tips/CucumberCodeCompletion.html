        Cucumber features can be rather verbose. That's why RubyMine's code completion
        (<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CodeCompletion;</span>) allows type character strings located anywhere within
        a description. The variants that contain the specified string as prefixes will be listed at the top of
        the suggestion list, followed by the variants with the arbitrary location of the search string.</p>
