<p>If there are too many breakpoints in your application, ease the search by
giving them names.</p>

<p>To add a name to a breakpoint, show the list of all breakpoints (<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ViewBreakpoints;</span>), 
right-click the one you are interested in, and edit its description.
</p>
<p>When later you'll look through the list in search of a particular breakpoint, 
just start typing its name:</p>
    <p class="image"><img src="images/named_breakpoint.png"></p>
