# The HSK
The HSK is like a stepping-stone to living in China. Whether you want to go to a Chinese college or work at a Chinese company, or whether you just want to communicate with Chinese people, the HSK serves as strong proof that you are linguistically qualified. Some Chinese colleges and companies even require that their foreign students and staff pass the HSK 4 (intermediate level) at the very least.
